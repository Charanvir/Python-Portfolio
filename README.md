## About Me

[View My Portfolio Here](https://charanvir-python-portfolio-home-gyb486.streamlit.app/)

Hi, my name is Charanvir Singh and I am a full stack developer. My primary programming language is JavaScript, but I
have always had an interest in Python. This portfolio is a place where I can showcase the projects that I have built,
with which I am learning the Python programming language. I hope to continue learning the language, and exciting
frameworks and libraries associated with Python. The projects will start to get more advanced as I learn the language
more, so stay tuned to see the cool projects and applications that I build.

This portfolio includes a functional Contact Me form, so if you have any tips on how to learn the language or cool
projects you would like to work on together, please feel free to visit my portfolio and contact me via the form.

Happy Coding!

## Projects

### Some projects included in my portfolio include:

### Todo List Web Application

Todo List Web Application is an easy-to-use application which allows users to manage tasks and items. Users can add new
items, modify existing items, and mark items as complete, effectively removing them from the todo list.
